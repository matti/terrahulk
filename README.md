# terrahulk

[Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) alternative. Less opinionated and written in shell script.

```
th climb <any terraform command>
  - Finds first terraberg.tf.template and terraberg.auto.tfvars.template files
    from parent dirs. Interpolates and copies them to all subfolders.
  - Runs terraform command in current dir and all sub dirs.
  - Intended use: $ tb climb apply -auto-approve

th fall <any terraform command>
  - Runs terraform command in all subdirs starting from the deepest path
  - Intended use: $ tb fall destroy -force

th clean terrahulk|terraform|state
  - Cleans terrahulk.tf and terrahulk.auto.tfvars, .terraform or local terraform state from sub directories
```

When the `WORKSPACE` environment variable is provided, then Terrahulk will switch to that env in every directory.

## install
